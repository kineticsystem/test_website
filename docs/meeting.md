Hardware simulation have recording videos.

For simulation data we show scatter plot and scene. In hardware mode we want to show the video as well.
We want a toggle to swithc between them.

We want a 3D scatter plot.

There will be two toggle.
One to display simualtion vs real data (which include video)

Second one is the error: euclidean distance error and rotation error.

Send link to Pythib file to update.

We visualize the error using a color map.
